Visio Stencils for Microsoft Configuration Manager (MECM, SCCM, ConfigrMgr, etc.)

I’ve updated for Microsoft Configuration Manager 2211 the Visio Stencils/Shapes (v1.8) that I’ve created for System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager. As a reminder, it is not official but based on some models seen in the Microsoft sessions. It is based on stencil that some people from the community had published for SCCM 2007. This new version includes the changes from CM 2211 and some others updates.
